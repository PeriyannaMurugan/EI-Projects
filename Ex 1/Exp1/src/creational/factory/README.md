Hereâ€™s a clean, **formal short README** content you can use for the **Factory Payment Integration** project:

# Factory Pattern â€“ Payment Integration System

##  Overview

This project demonstrates the **Factory Design Pattern** in Java using a real-world use case of a **Payment Integration System**.
The factory dynamically creates payment method objects (PayPal, Stripe, RazorPay) at runtime based on user input.
